# Number-Base-Converter

A very simple number base converter

It needs some improvements though


For example...
if you try convert f from base 12 into 2(binary) it'll work although that's not suppose to happen

but it'll give you an answer 

Of course it's wrong so

So I'll try fix it later!

It's just a small problem!

As long as people dont do ridiculous stuff like that,

it'll be fine!
